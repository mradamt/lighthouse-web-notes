## Groundrules TRAVIS
Lectures are conversations!
Ask questions by unmuting, or zoom chat, or zoom gestures

### Bootcamp vs CS
CS trains students in a lot of math and theory, but doesn't produce good developers at graduation. Bootcamps do developer training... (silence on the math and theory training)
Interview differences: person with degree will have a better understanding of architecture?
* Interviews vary
* Given some data and we need to remember x, y, z, how would you store this data most efficiently in a DB?
CS students will have lots more experience with the algorithms, data structures etc. Bootcampers will have far more familiarity with dev workflows, git, writing clean code that integrates with tests, passing code to seniors for review. Big tech is becoming less afraid of bootcamp grads, mainly if you can prove your credentials and your talents you should be fine. 

Travis notes that he's not actually feeding us kool-aid, he's a CS grad, both have their benefits. 


### Timeline
Weeks 1-5: FOCAL
Weeks 7-11: Web frameworks etc.
Week 6 and Weeks 11-12 are project weeks, no lectures.


## Incremental code
**Break the problem down into smaller, easier to understand, _isolated_ (if possible) steps.** Much easier in these cases to isolate erros, and refactor code in the future.
