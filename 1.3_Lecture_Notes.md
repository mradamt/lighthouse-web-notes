## Primitive data types
The value itself is stored in memory
The values are immutable. The values aren't 'changed', they are replaced.

Note that objects are not. So even a const object can be modified.
Primitive types are passed into functions as the data itself, i.e. a copy. Objects are passed by reference so the object itself is mutable. Check [pythontutor.com](pythontutor.com) to visualize.

## TIPS
1. Use 'const' everywhere unless JS tells us not to
2.
