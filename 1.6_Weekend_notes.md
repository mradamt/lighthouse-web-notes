Additionally, you can control where and how they get saved with some additional flags:

What does `--save-dev` (`-D`) do during `npm install [package] -D`? ---
  It saves the dev dependencies of the package you're installing. 
  Dev dependencies are packages you rely on to DEVELOP your app, but aren't required by users to actually run the app in production. This'll include things like testing packages, you only test in DEV not PROD, so test packages will live in the `package.json` file as `devDependencies`.
