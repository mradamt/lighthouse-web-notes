# Callbacks
(These are hard, give yourself time to figure it out)

Callback: function passed as a parameter and used by another function

## Function declaration vs expression
Functional expressions force better programming practices.

This is because of hoisting. Functions are hoisted in JS, so functions can be called before their declarations, which is a confusing way to sequence a program. E.g. when reviewing code, I don't know if this func is native, or pulled in from somewhere else etc.

So using functional expressions means functions can not be called until the function expression is written. 


## Arrow functions
* Arrow functions change how the `this` keyword works. When using a method we need to be careful with how we use `this`.
